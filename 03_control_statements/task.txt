# Tution Discount Calculations

# Create a Python program to calculate the tution fee discount for
  students based on their grade levels and academic performance.

Get your input for the following information:
    Student's names
    Student's grade level (1-12)
    Base tution fee
    Discount percentage
    Academic Topper status (eg. whether the student is an academic topper or not:)

Determine the discount based on the following rules:
    For student in grade 9 to 12:
      If they are academic toppers, apply 20% discount.
      Otherwise, apply a 10% discount.
    For students in grades 6 to 8, apply a 5% discount.
    For grades below 6, apply no discount.

Additional Discounts:
     For grade 10, add an additional 3% discount.
     For grade 12, add an additional 5% discount.
     No additional discounts for other grades.

Calculate the final tution fee after paying the discount:
     Calculate discount amount
     Calculate final fee

Output following:
     Student name
     Grade level
     Academic topper status (Yes/No)
     Base tution fee
     Total discount percentage
     Discount amount saved
     Final tution fee after discount
