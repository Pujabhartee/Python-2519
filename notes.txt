-> Variables
    -> Variables are names for memory locations, which are used to store data for processing.

       -> Persistent Data (Permanent Data / Long Term Data)

          -> Hard Disk

       -> Non-Persistent Data (Temporary Data)

          -> RAM (Memory)

    -> A variable allows you to

       -> Assign Data

       -> Manipulates Data (If Required)

       -> Retrieve Data

    -> Syntax
       
       -> variable_name = value
           
           student_age = 25

          = Assignment operator

    -> Note: In Python, the type of a variable can change during execution.

    -> Note: A function does a task, and is represented usinf ()

    -> type() - what is the data type of specified variable

    -> id() - gives the memory address/location of variable

    -> a = 10 c = 10 Even though a and c are different variables,
                     Python optimizes memory and may reuse the same object.

    -> Mutable Data : Data that can change / can be changed (Modify)
       
       -> Lists, Dictionaries, Sets etc

    -> Immutable Data : Data that cannot be changed (Non Modifiable)
       
       -> numbers, strings, tuples, etc.

    -> Any variable data, we can be output using print()

    -> Operator overloading - a single operator exhibits multiple behaviours
                              based on the input data given.(OOPS Principle - Polymorphism )
