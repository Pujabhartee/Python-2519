-> Variables
    -> Variables are names for memory locations, which are used to store data for processing.

       -> Persistent Data (Permanent Data / Long Term Data)

          -> Hard Disk

       -> Non-Persistent Data (Temporary Data)

          -> RAM (Memory)

    -> A variable allows you to

       -> Assign Data

       -> Manipulates Data (If Required)

       -> Retrieve Data

    -> Syntax
       
       -> variable_name = value
           
           student_age = 25

          = Assignment operator

    -> Note: In Python, the type of a variable can change during execution.

    -> Note: A function does a task, and is represented usinf ()

    -> type() - what is the data type of specified variable

    -> id() - gives the memory address/location of variable

    -> a = 10 c = 10 Even though a and c are different variables,
                     Python optimizes memory and may reuse the same object.

    -> Mutable Data : Data that can change / can be changed (Modify)
       
       -> Lists, Dictionaries, Sets etc

    -> Immutable Data : Data that cannot be changed (Non Modifiable)
       
       -> numbers, strings, tuples, etc.

    -> Any variable data, we can be output using print()

    -> Operator overloading - a single operator exhibits multiple behaviours
                              based on the input data given.(OOPS Principle - Polymorphism )

============

 -> What is concatenation?
    -> Joining multiple strings

-> What is interpolation?
    -> interpolation in programming means replacing placeholders with actual values

-> Using f-string (Formatted String Literals)
   
   -> An f-String allows you to embed variables directly inside a string using {}


 -> A variable allows you to

       -> Assign Data
          -> Manipulates Data (If Required)
       -> Retrieve Data

-> Operators

   -> In python, an operator is symbol which perform an operation on 
      variables and values

   -> To Manipulate Data we need Operators

   -> Types of Operators
     
      -> Arithmetic Operators - Mathematical calculations
          ->  + - * / % 
          -> // -floor division (same as division, but round off value)
          -> ** -exponentation

   -> Compound Assignment Operators
      
      -> Python provides Operators to combine Arithmetic and Assignment Operators
          -> For concise (short hand) coding 
          -> x = x + 5 --> x += 5

   -> Comparison Operators

      -> Used to compare values and return a boolean type (True/False) as result
      -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

   -> Logical Operators
     
      -> Used to combine multiple conditions (boolean values) 
      -> and - return True, when all conditions are True
      -> or - return True, when at least one condition is True
      -> not - negates the boolean value, if value is True then its result is False

   -> Membership Operators

   -> Identity Operators

   -> Bitwise Operators (Generally used in low level languages)
